# Firebase React Todo

**(firebase-react-todo)**

A test repo trying out firebase with Express and React to create a simple Todo List app.

Open 2 terminals:
- Root folder and run ``firebase serve``
- Root/view folder and run ``yarn start``

You will also need to adapt the firebase stuff to your firebase app name, region, etc.
