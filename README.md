# Firebase React Todo

**(firebase-react-todo)**

A test repo trying out firebase with Express and React to create a simple Todo List app.

Open 2 terminals:
- Root folder and run ``firebase serve``
- Root/view folder and run ``yarn start``

You will also need to adapt the firebase stuff to your firebase app name, region, etc.

Also provided is a Postman collection for testing the API. NB: I never used ``firebase deploy`` like the tutorial does (deploy requires setting up a credit card and upgrading to the paid version of Firebase), always just use ``firebase serve`` instead whenever the tutorial asks you to hit deploy.
